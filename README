# **Codes and dataset for the experiments described in the paper.**

## **File and directory description:**

checkpoints: Contains the checkpoints used to save the training progress in case of any interruptions
model: Contains model weights for the best model
results: Prediction logits and probabilities of each iteration

experiment_code.ipynb: The notebook used for the experiment
requirements.txt: Contains the dependencies required to run the code
original_and_preprocessed.zip: The dataset used in the experiment 

How do install dependencies:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

How to run the code:

1. Open the experiment_code.ipynb in Jupyter notebook
2. Run the cells in the notebook
3. The code will train the model and save the best model in the model directory
4. The code will also save the prediction logits and probabilities in the results directory
5. The code will also save the checkpoints in the checkpoints directory

Note: The code was executed in an Amazon EC2 instance with GPU 
It can also be executed in Google Colab. However, a GPU is required otherwise it is not feasible. 
Remember to mount the drive before executing.
